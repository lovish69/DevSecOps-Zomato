# DevSecOps Project: CI/CD Pipeline with Security and Monitoring

This project implements a complete DevSecOps pipeline using Jenkins for CI/CD, integrated with security scanning tools like SonarQube, OWASP Dependency-Check, Trivy, Docker image analysis, and a monitoring stack using Prometheus and Grafana. ArgoCD is used for GitOps-based deployment on a Kubernetes cluster.

## üîÅ Pipeline Flow

1. **VS Code to GitHub**: Code is pushed to a GitHub repository.
2. **Jenkins Pipeline**:
    - Checks out the code.
    - Runs **SonarQube analysis** for code quality and bug detection.
    - Uses **OWASP Dependency-Check** to scan for vulnerable packages.
    - Executes **Trivy** to identify vulnerabilities in Docker images.
3. **Build and Push**:
    - Builds Docker image.
    - Pushes to **DockerHub**.
    - Scans pushed image using **Docker Scout**.
4. **Deployment**:
    - Uses **Helm** charts.
    - ArgoCD automatically pulls the Helm manifests and deploys them to Kubernetes.
5. **Monitoring & Alerts**:
    - Prometheus scrapes metrics from K8s pods.
    - Grafana visualizes the metrics.
    - Gmail notifications are triggered based on metrics/alerts.

---

## üìä Monitoring Dashboard

- Prometheus collects pod metrics (CPU, memory, availability).
- Grafana dashboards visualize application health and alert thresholds.

---

## üîê Security Features

- **Code Quality Gate** via SonarQube.
- **Static Dependency Scanning** with OWASP.
- **Docker Image Vulnerability Scanning** using Trivy and Docker Scout.
- **Manual Approval Gate** before production deployment (optional).

---

## üì¨ Notifications

- Gmail notifications can be configured via SMTP plugin in Jenkins or from ArgoCD Alerts.
